            <p className='my-2 px-4'>Congratulations, you've officially crushed all the chapters you have enrolled in! ðŸŽ‰ You watched all the videos, aced the quizzes, and now, my friend, youâ€™re the economist everyone wishes they could hang out with at parties (â€¦just go with it).</p>
            <p className='my-2 px-4'>But wait, thereâ€™s more! If youâ€™re craving more economic enlightenment (or looking for a distraction from another re-watch of <em>The Office</em>), there are still chapters you havenâ€™t signed up for. Go aheadâ€”dive back in, add those new ones, or do a power rewatch of your favorites.</p>
            <p className='my-2 px-4'>And now, the moment youâ€™ve been waiting for: your Mastery of Topics chart below! Yes, itâ€™s like your very own stats in a video gameâ€”except instead of maxing out agility or charm, you've leveled up in things like Price Elasticity and Marginal Cost. Take a look, bask in the glory of your economic dominance, and feel free to screenshot and send it to that one friend who still thinks â€˜opportunity costâ€™ is a new cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p className='my-2 px-4'>And hey, if youâ€™ve secretly enjoyed the thrilling world of supply and demand, donâ€™t keep it to yourself. Tell a friend! Theyâ€™ll thank you later...maybe. Or they'll pretend they didn't see your text. Either way, you are the econ star we all need. Shine on!</p>
