            <div className='w-3/4 text-center mt-10'>Welcome to the Quiz Generator—where we tirelessly crunch data so you can finally conquer those pesky weak spots that have haunted your econ journey! Think of this as your very own "weakness whacker" (patent pending). Just tell us if you want a custom quiz for every unit you've studied so far, or if you'd rather laser-focus on the chapters that really tripped you up. Or, if you're feeling brave (or reckless), go off-script and create your own quiz by topic or chapter! We promise it’ll be almost painless—probably less like pulling teeth and more like... a slightly awkward lecture on interest rates.</div>
