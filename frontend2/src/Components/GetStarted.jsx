                                    "economists spotting an error in a government budget" level of excitement. 
                                    üßê You, my friend, have just joined a group of elite learners who are ready 
                                    to unravel the mysteries of supply, demand, and why avocado toast costs more 
                                    than your rent.</div>

                                First things first: let's get you rolling! The next step is to choose the units 
                                you want to study. It‚Äôs like picking out the episodes of a show that actually 
                                teach you something (without putting you into a deep nap). Once you‚Äôve made your 
                                selections, you‚Äôll get to enjoy our signature blend of videos that don‚Äôt suck, 
                                because‚Äîlet‚Äôs be honest‚Äîsome econ videos really do. We‚Äôre fixing that one laugh at a time.

                                Here‚Äôs how it works: watch the video, then strut your stuff in a review quiz. 
                                You might crush it. You might‚Ä¶ not. But don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôve got your back! Our 
                                fancy algorithm will remember what tripped you up (yeah, we know, algorithms 
                                are spooky like that). The next time around, it‚Äôll throw you questions that 
                                help you face your quiz demons, so you can tackle those wrong answers like a pro.
