                        <div>Welcome to EVTDS (Economics Videos That Don’t Suck)! 🎉 We can’t believe 
                            it either—you signed up! Did we mention we’re ridiculously excited? Like, 
                            "economists spotting an error in a government budget" level of excitement. 
                            🧐 You, my friend, have just joined a group of elite learners who are ready 
                            to unravel the mysteries of supply, demand, and why avocado toast costs more 
                            than your rent.</div>

                        First things first: let's get you rolling! The next step is to choose the units 
                        you want to study. It’s like picking out the episodes of a show that actually 
                        teach you something (without putting you into a deep nap). Once you’ve made your 
                        selections, you’ll get to enjoy our signature blend of videos that don’t suck, 
                        because—let’s be honest—some econ videos really do. We’re fixing that one laugh at a time.

                        Here’s how it works: watch the video, then strut your stuff in a review quiz. 
                        You might crush it. You might… not. But don’t worry, we’ve got your back! Our 
                        fancy algorithm will remember what tripped you up (yeah, we know, algorithms 
                        are spooky like that). The next time around, it’ll throw you questions that 
                        help you face your quiz demons, so you can tackle those wrong answers like a pro.

                        So buckle up—it’s going to be a fun, thrilling, hopefully not soul-crushing 
                        ride through the magical world of economics. If at any point you’re wondering 
                        "What have I done?" don’t worry—you’re exactly where you need to be. 🚀
